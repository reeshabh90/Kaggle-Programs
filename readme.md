# INTRODUCTION
This Repository captures my working projects w.r.t Kaggle datasets, in my journey to learn ML/AI.

# DISCLAIMER
Most of the code snippets are inspired from submisson of other candidates as I am in the learning phase
and trying to learn from the solutions of the experts on Kaggle community.

I am maintaining this repository for my code reference and to review the learnings in the future,
as I move on to solving bigger problems in ML/AI field.
